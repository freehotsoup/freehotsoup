    Once logged on they click the ticket tab/button/etc
    They look at the tickets that have been submitted
    Fullfiller sees someone wants/needs an item
    (i.e. a coat M-L)
    If they have access to one that fits the description
        They can personally deliver it
        They click own (as in now they own that ticket/responsibility)

        (Internally a email/text/etc is sent to the requester)

        Fullfiller uses the address/gps provided to deliver the item
        They also will used the description provided
        To determine how to identify the person requesting

        If they can provide the item to the intended recepient
            They do so
        If not
            If they see someone else that clearly is in stron need
                They offer the item to them
            If not
                They close the ticket as incomplete
                They take the item to the warehouse
    If not
        They attempt to find one at the warehouse or ignore the ticket
    If certain that the item does not exist
